# KaWSploit

**KaWSploit** is a Proof of Concept (PoC) for exploiting the PvP mechanics in **Kingdoms at War (KaW)**, showcasing the lack of rate limiting on player actions. PvP actions face minimal restrictions, and PvE actions have none.

## Developer Criticism

The developers allow players who spend money on the game to actively cheat and bot, while chat-muting users who call out the cheaters. They even stripped a beloved player moderator of his powers for pointing out cheaters to the developers.

## Usage

Before running the exploit, **edit `Auth.cs`** to customize your:
- `androidID`
- `deviceID`
- `advertisingID`

Failing to change these values may result in a ban due to flagged data.
